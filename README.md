Logicando
====================

Logicando was my course conclusion work in CEFET-MG. Its a intuitive web plataform composed of some games and tutorials
created to teach logic and programming concepts to teen students (or anyone who want to learn). It was built using HTML5,CSS3
and the Java LibGDX library.
