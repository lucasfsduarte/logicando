Logicando
====================

Logicando was my course conclusion work in CEFET-MG. Its a intuitive web plataform composed of some games and tutorials
created to teach logic and programming concepts to teen students (or anyone who want to learn). It was built using HTML5, CSS3
and the Java LibGDX library.

How to run
====================

Logicando is a php based application, so its need of some sgbd, php and apache to work. I used WAMP during all the building
process. After the package installation, open the sgbd, import the database and put logicando archives into the www directory.
After all this you can get acess to the system. To do, just type localhost/logicando in your preffered browser.

Credits

====================

This application wasn't built alone. Vítor Luís G, Bruno V. Ventura and Tchr. Alisson Rodrigo dos Santos they made part of my development
group. They help were very important and without them this code could not exist.
